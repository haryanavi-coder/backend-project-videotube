Lecture-5
Data Modelling 

what will be stored?
username, password, pjhotos, dob, mobile no., etc.

mongoose use kr rhe h
data modelling k liye

expensive:(used in coorporations)
draw at moon modeler and it will give codes 
moon modeler: https://www.datensen.com/data-modeling/moon-modeler-for-databases.html

other options:
eraser.io
https://www.eraser.io/


free option:
pen and paper

helper:
prisma
mongoose


***********************************************************************************
Lecture:- 10 (User and video model with hooks and JWT)

index in modelling: to searching
password is stored in database in encripted form, as db can get leaked

mongo aggregation
https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2

mongoose middlewares pre, post 
read from documentation

based on crypography
bcrypt  : used to hash the passwords
jwt : for tokens

cryptographic algorithms are used to encrypt/decrypt the passwords and tokens
in them a secret key is used to make them unique

to use them some mongoose hooks are used like pre (find more in mongoose>middleware>pre)
userSchema.pre('save', callback)
in this keep in mind not to wite arrow function as it don't have this (context) information

to compare
userSchema.methods.isPasswordCorrect


JWT (http://www.jwt.io) || also can see github pageb
it is bearer token: what it means it that jiske pass hote h unko access de do
jsonwebtoken

serect ke liye shark 256, 

we are using sessions and cookies both (added security)
access token is not stored in db, but refresh are 

both are written in same way, we will learn about them in upcomming lectures 


similiarly inke liye bhi function likh do 
userSchema.methods.generateAccessToken = function(){}
userSchema.methods.generateRefreshToken = function(){}

ek usename aa gya to querry kr sakte hain

LECTURE- 10 (Multer: upload file in backend)

pdf upload, image upload and all others 
it is all work of backend engineers

multer 
it npm package 

2 steps setting
firstly upload file on using multer on local server
then upload it to cloudinary

many have diff folder as services for cloudinary
we will use utils

import fs from "fs"
fs is file system
it is in core nodejs

search in unlink in documentation (nodejs documentation)


now setup a middleware using multer
read multer docs --github wale


multer file middleware
we can also have difff image ids 

*****************************************************************************************************************
LECTURE - 12 (Controllers and Routing)

wrapper function use kiya as baar baar try catch , promises nhi daalne pade, 

write controller, routes in separate files and will import them not in index.js as we try to keep it clean
so write in app.js file

********************************************************************************************************************
LECTURE - 13
LOGIC BUILDING

// get user details from frontend
// validation - not empty
// check if user already exists: username, email
// check for images, check for avatar
// upload them to cloudinary, avatar
// create user object - create entry in db
// remove password and refresh token field from response
// check for user creation
// return res

data handle by json, req, res, postman
but file handling is by multer

for validation in production grade apps diff files are written and from them methods are called

similiarly write code logic for all above 


********************************************************************************************************************
LECTURE - 14
How to use postman

in big tech companies Postman collection is shared

in postman to post data use
body>raw> [json] but in this json we can't snd file

body>form-data>         click on ... dots and enable content-type


good thing abot clodinary:
if you don't send image then it just returns "" empty string

LECTURE -15
LOGOUT, REFRESH AND ACCESS TOKENS BASICS

both are used for authorization
no need to have both always
one is short term and other is long term expiry date


IMP 
how to write querry for finding either username or email for login (like instagram) from MONGODB


access token given to user
but refresh token is saved to database also so that baar refresh na karna pade

***************
logout

how to logout properly?
> by deleting access token, refresh token

how to find the user
:> we will add our middleware
auth.midddleware.js


if res is not used in middleware then you can write it as _    [PRODUCTION GRADE CODE]

*************************************************************************************************************
LECTURE - 16 
TOKENS

refresh token:- long lived, stored in database
access token:- short lived, not stored in database, will be with user

when access token is expired then user get 401, and then it should hit an endpoint which will give new access and refresh token after authentication
by this user does not have to login again 


kai jagah throw karna hi acha h error(API error hi  api response h yaha)
200 ka fake response is very very very very bad thing

*************
options ko global me declare kar sakte hain
*************


************************************************************************************************
LECTURE-17


to test /login write in body>raw> and json


database me raw token store hota h 
user k pass jo jata h vo encrypted hota h 


declare options {http, secure } as global



updateaccountdetails:
we can allow anyfield to be updated by the user

files ko update alag se kro [PRODUCTION GRADE CODE]

























Why utils?
24:50 of video custom api response

wrapper function to make our life easy
